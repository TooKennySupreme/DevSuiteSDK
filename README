DevSuiteSDK
===========
The DevSuiteSDK is a Software Development Kit for Aptina's USB Demo Hardware (Demo2X, Demo3).
For the full DevSuite Installation for Windows go to http://www.aptina.com/support/Devsuite.jsp

This distribution includes some of the basic libraries/APIs which are now available for Mac OS X and Linux

There are two sample applications currently available.  SimpleCapture (samples/SimpleCapture) is a command line application that grabs an image from the demo camera.  
It is based on the ApBase library.  SimpleQt is a GUI based Qt application that displays the images from the demo camera.  This is also based on the ApBase library.

The non-NDA data files are located in apps_data (initialization files) and sensor_data (register reference file).  
For other parts please copy your data files into these directories.
