DevSuiteSDK
===========
The DevSuiteSDK is a Software Development Kit for Aptina's USB Demo Hardware (Demo2X, Demo3).
For the full DevSuite Installation for Windows go to http://www.aptina.com/support/Devsuite.jsp

This distribution includes some of the basic libraries/APIs which are now available for Mac OS X and Linux

The Sample application (samples/SimpleCapture_Midlib) is a command line application that grabs an image from the demo camera.  
It is based on the Midlib library (note that this will soon be deprecated by ApBase library).  

The non-NDA data files are located in apps_data (initialization files) and sensor_data (register reference file).  
For other parts please copy your data files into these directories.
