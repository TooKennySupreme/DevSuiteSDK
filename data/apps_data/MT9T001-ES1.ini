; This file holds groups of register presets (sections) specific for this sensor. The 
; presets allow you to overwrite the power-on default settings with optimized register 
; settings. 
; The [Demo Initialization] section contains all optimized register settings for running
; the sensor in the demo environment. Other sections include settings optimized for a
; veriety of situations like: Running at different master clock speeds, running under
; different lighting situations, running with different lenses, etc.
; Most of the demonstration software (DevWare, SensorDemo, ...) make use of this file
; to load and store the user presets.
;
; Keyname description:
; REG      = assign a new register value
; BITFIELD = do a READ-MODIFY-WRITE to part of a register. The part is defined as a mask.
; FIELD_WR = Write any register, variable or bitfield, specified by its symbol name
; LOAD     = load an alternate section from this section
; STATE    = set non-register state
; DELAY    = delay a certain amount of milliseconds before continuing 
; POLL_REG = Read a register a specified number of times, or until the register
;            value no longer meets a specified condition. You specify the
;            register by its address, and it only works with simple registers.
;            You also specify a delay between each iteration of the loop.
; POLL_FIELD = Like POLL_REG except you specify the register by its symbol name
;            as defined in the sensor data file. POLL_FIELD works with any kind
;            of register or variable.
;
; Keyname format:
; REG      = [<page>,] <address>, <value>             //<comment>
; BITFIELD = [<page>,] <address>, <mask>, <value>
;            Some examples: 
;            BITFIELD=2, 0x05, 0x0020, 1 //for register 5 on page 2, set the 6th bit to 1
;            BITFIELD=0x06, 0x000F, 0    //for register 6, clear the first 4 bits
; FIELD_WR = <registername>, [<bitfieldname>,] <value>
; LOAD     = <section>
; STATE    = <state>, <value>
; DELAY    = <milliseconds>
; POLL_REG = [<page>,]<address>,<mask>,<condition>,DELAY=<milliseconds>,TIMEOUT=<count> //<comment>
;            Example:  Poll every 50ms, stop when value <= 8 or after 5 times (250ms).
;            POLL_REG= 2, 0x3F, 0xFFFF, >8, DELAY=50, TIMEOUT=5
; POLL_FIELD = <registername>, [<bitfieldname>,] <condition>, DELAY=<milliseconds>, TIMEOUT=<count> //<comment>
;            Example:  Poll every 10 ms, stop when the value = 0, or after 500ms.
;            POLL_FIELD= SEQ_CMD, !=0, DELAY=10, TIMEOUT=50
;
; <page>         Optional address space for this register. Some sensors (mostly SOC's)
;                have multiple register pages (see the sensor spec or developers guide)
; <address>      the register address
; <value>        the new value to assign to the register
; <mask>         is the part of a register value that needs to be updated with a new value
; <registername> Name of a register or variable as defined the sensor data (.sdat) file
; <bitfieldname> Optional name of a bitfield
; <condition>    <  <=  ==  !=  >  or  >=  followed by a numerical value
; <count>        Number of iterations of the polling loop
; <section>      the name of another section to load
; <state>        non-register program state names [do not modify]
; <milliseconds> wait for this ammount of milliseconds before continuing 
; <comment>      Some form of C-style comments are supported in this .ini file
